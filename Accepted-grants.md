## [Summa](https://summa.one/) - Bitcoin-spv ([github](https://github.com/summa-tx/bitcoin-spv))
Bitcoin-spv is a low-level toolkit for working with Bitcoin from CKB and other blockchains. It supplies a set of pure functions that can be used to validate almost all Bitcoin transactions and headers, as well as higher-level functions that can evaluate header chains and transaction inclusion proofs. It also supplies a standardized JSON format for proofs. Currently off-chain proof (de)serialization is supported in Golang, Python, & JS.

## [Lay2](https://lay2.dev/) - PW SDK ([GitHub](https://github.com/lay2dev))

PW SDK is a simple and powerful SDK for building CKB dApps.

-   [PW Core](https://github.com/lay2dev/pw-core) - a front-end JS SDK based on Typescript, which allows developers to directly develop CKB dApps that run in all the blockchain wallets supported by PW lock.
-   [PW lock](https://github.com/lay2dev/pw-lock) - a generic multi-chain lock script that verifies signatures from other blockchains, and maps the addresses provided to a valid CKB address.
-   PW lib - various types of cryptographic primitives such as the Keccak-256 hash library for verifying Ethereum signatures, the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) Secp256r1 (NIST P-256) library, and more.
